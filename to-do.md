# To-Do

* Add websites to the database**
* Add an "open link" button to the results
    * This can be accomplished by having a new _div_ element with the same styling as the others and having a button's link change with the information using JavaScript.
* Add a "news" category for certain websites
    * Using API? Maybe having a "news" that is true or false. If true, could it use the "newsLink" to load something in?
* Add the option for users to add reviews
    * Accomplishable by having an API, or using a Google form? 
* More advanced ratings
* Better styling
* Make it into an extension
* Move all of the website data into the website-data repository and link the code that way.
