# To-Do

* Add websites to the database**
* Add an "open link" button to the results
    * This can be accomplished by having a new _div_ element with the same styling as the others and having a button's link change with the information using javascript.
* Add a "news" category for certain websites
    * Using API? Maybe having a "news" that is true or false. If it's true, then it could use the "newsLink" to load something in?
* Add the option for users to add reviews
    * Accomplishable by having an API, or using a Google form? 
* More advanced ratings
* Better styling
* Make it into an extension
* Change database into MySQL
  * I am considering this option, however the only problem I currently have is the accessibility of the SQL database. There might be a way to link it to GitHub. If you know of any ways, open up an issue with that and I will get back to you.
